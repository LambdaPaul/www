Just when I thought this game exhausted everything it has to offer, it introduces a new mechanic.
Just when I thought I mastered this game, it introduces something new and adds to the complexity.

I do not know how to compare it to a typical puzzle game because this game is in a sub-genre on its own. You write the rules to your suiting. However many level constrain the rules so you have to work with the ones that level does not have "locked." The early levels are relatively straight-forward, as they act as tutorials. But the difficulty curve goes up and up until you hit a roadblock and get stuck on it for hours. That is when you play a different level. Yes, the game has this over-world similar to the one in Super Mario World where you access levels and sub-worlds. Beating a level unlocks the surrounding locked levels and a dandelion-looking thing (it is really never explained). Sub-worlds are also unlocked by beating levels and collecting those dandelions. There are other collectibles too that are awarded based on set criteria but that would be too much information for new players and for a review.

Do not let the cutesy art style and music in the trailers and other promotional media distract you. This game is extremely difficult. But the moment a solution clicks in a level, there is no better feeling.

Speaking of music, I feel it is the weakest part of the game. The main theme is simple but catchy and the rest are somewhat forget-able.
